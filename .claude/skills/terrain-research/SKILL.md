# TERRAIN Research

Use this skill before standardizing a new contract, changing a benchmark, or
making a cross-repo adoption decision.

## Workflow

1. State the research question and the decision it informs.
2. Inspect local evidence first: README, specs, tests, fixtures, benchmarks, and
   dependency trackers.
3. Check external sources only when needed for ecosystem or protocol claims.
4. Record findings with IDs, citations, implications, confidence, and non-goals.
5. Split recommendations into adopt now, prototype, and defer/reject.
6. Run or cite validation commands for measurable claims.

## Output

Write a repo-local research note under `docs/research/`, then update any
affected tracker or dependency-system file.
